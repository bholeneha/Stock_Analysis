# An Analysis of Stocks Data 

## Overview 

Steve is a recent graduate with a finance degree. His parents are going to be his first clients. They are passionate about green energy and are interested in investing in green energy stocks. Steve's parents are particularly interested in investing in the DAQO stock however Steve wants to analyze multiple stocks to better advise his parents. Steve has created a excel file containing a dozen green energy stock data and needs help analyzing it. 

### Purpose

Steve wants to advise his parents on which green stocks to invest in. Hence, the purpose of the project is to analyze stock data to determine how the given stocks performed in the year 2017 and 2018. 

### Analysis

The [stocks data set](VBA_Challenge.xlsm) used in this analysis contains data on a dozen green energy stocks from the year 2017 to 2018. The data set was loaded in Excel and processed using VBA. The VBA code was refactored to automate analysis on multiple stocks if Steve wanted to analyze more stocks and do so efficiently. Additionally, buttons were added on the worksheets for easy access to running the analyses.   

### Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
